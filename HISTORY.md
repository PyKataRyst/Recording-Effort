# Development History

This document outlines the development journey of the "Recording Effort" application, including key decisions, pivots, and feature implementations.

## Phase 1: Core Foundation
- **Initial Setup**: Project initialized with Vite, React, and TypeScript.
- **Styling Architecture**: Setup Tailwind CSS v4 with Shadcn/UI-inspired color tokens.
- **Core Features**: Implemented `useTimer` and `useHistory` hooks.
  - Basic stopwatch functionality.
  - `localStorage` persistence for history.
  - CSV Export functionality.

## Phase 2: Architecture Refinement (The "Single File" Pivot)
- **Challenge**: Encountered module resolution issues and complexity with scattered components.
- **Decision**: Consolidated core logic into `src/App.tsx` for simplicity and robustness. This dramatically speeded up iteration.
- **Firebase Attempt**: Briefly attempted to integrate Firebase for cloud sync.
- **Rollback**: User opted effectively for a "Local First" approach. Removed Firebase to maintain simplicity and privacy (Simplicity > Complexity).

## Phase 3: V2 Features (Shortcuts & Stats)
- **Task Shortcuts**: Implemented smart suggestions based on history frequency.
- **Dashboard**: Added a "Statistics" tab showing:
  - Today's Total
  - All-Time Total
  - Task Breakdown
- **Timer Fix**: Changed display format to `HH:MM:SS` (removed milliseconds) to reduce visual jitter.

## Phase 4: PWA & Mobile Optimization (iPhone Support)
- **PWA Setup**: Implemented manual PWA support (`manifest.json`, `index.html` meta tags) after `vite-plugin-pwa` issues.
- **Network Access**: Configured Vite (`host: true`) to allow LAN access for mobile testing.
- **UUID Polyfill**: Fixed a crash on non-HTTPS connections by replacing `crypto.randomUUID()` with a robust fallback.
- **Background Timer**:
  - Implemented `localStorage` state saving to restore timer after app closure/reload.
  - **Lock Screen Support**: Used the Media Session API (playing silent audio) to display the timer on the iPhone lock screen.

## Phase 5: UI Refinement (The "Stylish" Update)
- **Buttons**: Replaced standard buttons with gradient styles (Rose for Stop, Emerald for Record).
- **Layout**: Simplified controls to a 3-button layout (Start, Reset, Record), removing the Lap button.
- **Visuals**:
  - Implemented **Glassmorphism** (backdrop blur) for cards and inputs.
  - Added animated background blobs for a premium feel.
  - Refined gradients, shadows, and border radii (`rounded-3xl` etc).
- **UX**: Persisted "Task Name" input so users don't lose context on reload.

## Phase 6: Stability & DevOps (Startup Fix & Automation)
- **Stability Improvement**:
  - **Issue**: App startup failure due to potential `localStorage` access issues or corrupted data.
  - **Solution**: Implemented `SafeStorage` wrapper to handle storage errors gracefully without crashing.
  - **Safety Net**: Added `ErrorBoundary` component to catch unexpected errors and provide a "Reset Data" option, preventing "White Screen of Death".
- **DevOps (Experimental)**:
  - Explored GitHub Actions for automation (Selenium scraping bot).
  - Setup and then cleaned up the experiment (removed `headless_bot.py` and workflows) to keep the repository focused on the main application.


## Phase 7: Visualization Overhaul
- **Line Chart Implementation**: Replaced heatmap with a 30-day trend line chart using `recharts`.
- **Task Summary Cards**: Added "Task Totals" cards to the Statistics dashboard for quick aggregate views.
- **UI Improvements**: Enhanced the Statistics layout with a responsive grid and better data visualization.

## Phase 7b: Robustness Improvement
- **Background Audio Compatibility**: Removed the "Silent Audio" hack that was interrupting background apps (Spotify, Audible).
- **Robust Timer Logic**: Refactored timer to use Delta Time calculation, ensuring accuracy even when the app is suspended or reloaded without needing active background processing.

---

## Phase 7c: Enhanced Insights
- **Task Summary Cards 2.0**: Overhauled the summary cards to prioritize "Today's Effort".
    - **Today Highlight**: Prominent display of the current day's duration with pulse animation for active tasks.
    - **Extended Metrics**: Added "Daily Average" and "Total" stats for better long-term tracking.
    - **Zero State**: Cleaner presentation for tasks with no activity today.

- **Phase 8**: Social Sharing (New)
    - [x] "Share this App" button in footer.
    - [x] Web Share API integration for native sharing on mobile.
    - [x] Clipboard fallback with toast notification for desktop.
